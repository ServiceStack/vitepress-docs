src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/aws/servicestack-aws-banner-420.png" alt=""></p><p>In this release we&#39;ve started increasing ServiceStack&#39;s value beyond its primary focus of simple, fast and productive libraries and started looking towards improving integration with outside environments for hosting ServiceStack Services. This release marks just the beginning, we&#39;ll continue enhancing the complete story around developing, deploying and hosting your ServiceStack solutions ensuring it provides seamless integration with the best Single Page Apps, Mobile/Desktop technologies and Cloud/Hosting Services that share our simplicity, performance and value-focused goals that we believe provide the best return on effort and have the most vibrant ecosystems.</p><h2 id="net-before-cloud-services" tabindex="-1">.NET before Cloud Services <a class="header-anchor" href="#net-before-cloud-services" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>One thing we&#39;ve missed from being based on .NET is its predisposition towards Windows-only technologies, missing out on all the industrial strength server solutions that are being primarily developed for hosting on Linux. This puts .NET at a disadvantage to other platforms which have first-class support for using the best technologies at their discretion, which outside of .NET, are primarily running on Linux servers. We&#39;ve historically ignored this bias in .NET and have always focused on simple technologies we&#39;ve evaluated that provide the best value. Often this means we&#39;ve had to maintain rich .NET clients ourselves to get a great experience in .NET which is what led us to develop first-class <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redis client</a> and why <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrmLite</a> has first-class support for major RDBMS running on Linux inc. PostgreSQL, MySql, Sqlite, Oracle and Firebird - all the while ensuring ServiceStack&#39;s libraries runs cross-platform on Mono/Linux.</p><h2 id="aws-s-servicified-platform-and-polyglot-ecosystem" tabindex="-1">AWS&#39;s servicified platform and polyglot ecosystem <a class="header-anchor" href="#aws-s-servicified-platform-and-polyglot-ecosystem" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>By building their managed platform behind platform-agnostic web services, Amazon have largely eroded this barrier. We can finally tap into the same ecosystem <a href="https://techstacks.io/tech/amazon-ec2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">innovative Startups are using</a> with nothing more than the complexity cost of a service call - the required effort even further reduced with native clients. Designing its services behind message-based APIs made it much easier for Amazon to enable a new polyglot world with <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/developer-resources/#SDK" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native clients for most popular platforms</a>, putting .NET on a level playing field with other platforms thanks to <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS SDK for .NET&#39;s</a> well-maintained typed native clients. By providing its functionality behind well-defined services, for the first time we&#39;ve seen in a long time, .NET developers are able to benefit from this new polyglot world where solutions and app logic written in other languages can be easily translated into .NET languages - a trait which has been invaluable whilst developing ServiceStack&#39;s integration support for AWS.</p><p>This also means features and improvements to reliability, performance and scalability added to its back-end servers benefit every language and ecosystem using them. .NET developers are no longer at a disadvantage and can now leverage the same platform Hacker Communities and next wave of technology leading Startups are built on, benefiting from the Tech Startup culture of sharing their knowledge and experiences and pushing the limits of what&#39;s possible today.</p><p>AWS offers unprecedented productivity for back-end developers, its servicified hardware and infrastructure encapsulates the complexity of managing servers at a high-level programmatic abstraction that&#39;s effortless to consume and automate. These productivity gains is why we&#39;ve been running our public servers on AWS for more than 2 years. The vast array of services on offer means we have everything our solutions need within the AWS Console, our RDS managed PostgreSQL databases takes care of automated backups and software updates, ease of snapshots means we can encapsulate and backup the configuration of our servers and easily spawn new instances. AWS has made software developers more capable than ever, and with its first-class native client support leveling the playing field for .NET, there&#39;s no reason why <a href="http://highscalability.com/blog/2012/4/9/the-instagram-architecture-facebook-bought-for-a-cool-billio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the next Instagram</a> couldn&#39;t be built by a small team of talented .NET developers.</p><h2 id="servicestack-amazon-web-services" tabindex="-1">ServiceStack + Amazon Web Services <a class="header-anchor" href="#servicestack-amazon-web-services" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>We&#39;re excited to participate in AWS&#39;s vibrant ecosystem and provide first-class support and deep integration with AWS where ServiceStack&#39;s decoupled substitutable functionality now seamlessly integrates with popular AWS back-end technologies. It&#39;s now more productive than ever to develop and host ServiceStack solutions entirely on the managed AWS platform!</p><h2 id="servicestack-aws" tabindex="-1">ServiceStack.Aws <a class="header-anchor" href="#servicestack-aws" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>All of ServiceStack&#39;s support for AWS is encapsulated within the single <strong>ServiceStack.Aws</strong> NuGet package which references the latest modular AWSSDK <strong>v3.1x</strong> dependencies <strong>.NET 4.5+</strong> projects can install from NuGet with:</p><pre><code>PM&gt; Install-Package ServiceStack.Aws

ServiceStack covers real-life problems that occur over the lifetime of a distributed system and how to solve them by deeply understanding the tools of ServiceStack. Distributed systems is the enterprise solution that provide flexibility, reliability, scaling, and performance. ServiceStack is an outstanding tool belt to create such a system in a frictionless manner, especially sophisticated designed and fun to use.</p><p>The book starts with an introduction covering the essentials, but assumes you are just refreshing, are a very fast learner, or are an expert in building web services. Then, the book explains ServiceStack&#39;s data transfer object patterns and teach you how it differs from other methods of building web services with different protocols, such as SOAP and SOA. It also introduces more low-level details such as how to extend the User Auth, message queues and concepts on how the technology works.</p><p>By the end of this book, you will understand the concepts, framework, issues, and resolutions related to ServiceStack.</p><h2 id="typescript" tabindex="-1"><a href="/typescript-add-servicestack-reference.html">TypeScript</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#typescript" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/Assets/master/img/wikis/typescript-banner.png" alt="ServiceStack and TypeScript Banner"></p><p>We&#39;ve extended our existing TypeScript support for generating interface definitions for your DTO&#39;s with the much requested <code>ExportAsTypes=true</code> option which instead generates non-ambient concrete TypeScript Types.
