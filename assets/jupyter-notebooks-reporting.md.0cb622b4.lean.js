This will include from cells that install dependencies using <code>%pip install</code> and anything else which you think doesn&#39;t add value to the final report. This can be done by selecting the cell in the web UI, going to the <code>Cell</code> menu and clicking <code>Current Outputs</code>-&gt;<code>Clear</code>.</p><p>Once this is done, we will need to run a command from a Terminal in the context of our running Docker container. The easiest way to do this is to use the Jupyter web UI itself.
