The overarching theme that has served us well over the years is a relentless pursuit for simplicity and seeking out the simplest solutions, with minimal abstractions, concepts that best solves any given problem.</p><p>Since its inception in 2008, this philosophy has helped ServiceStack become the worlds most versatile Services Framework - supporting an unparalleled number of <a href="/why-servicestack.html#multiple-pluggable-formats">Pluggable Formats</a>, multitude of <a href="/why-servicestack.html#multiple-endpoints">HTTP, SOAP and MQ Endpoints</a> that can be hosted in a <a href="/why-servicestack.html#multiple-hosting-options">variety of hosting scenarios</a> whilst providing a productive succinct, end-to-end Typed API for the most popular <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/add-servicestack-reference" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">native Mobile and Desktop</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile#client-applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET platforms</a>. In the time other vendors have left a <a href="/advantages-of-message-based-web-services.html#the-many-webservice-frameworks-of-microsoft">number of abandoned frameworks</a> and failed HTTP abstractions behind for their next framework rewrite, ServiceStack has managed to stay lean, fast and continually enhance and evolve its single code-base to support every major HTTP Host delivered with .NET with an order of magnitude less resources. This is only achievable due to our relentness pursuit of simplicity, focus on underlying value, <a href="/architecture-overview.html">rewriting friction-encumbered providers</a> whilst actively rejecting <a href="https://www.infoq.com/articles/interview-servicestack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unnecessary complexity and abstractions</a> and slow <a href="/why-not-odata.html">bloated technologies promoting well-known anti-patterns</a> whose resulting value does not justify the level of investment and effort required to adopt it.

Any guidelines, rules or processes we add to increase software quality should be directly focused on managing its essential complexity. One of the best things we can do to reduce complexity is to reduce code-base size, i.e. DRYing repeatable code and eliminating any unnecessary abstractions, indirection, concepts, types and friction that isn&#39;t absolutely essential to the software&#39;s function.</p><p>In this light, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YAGNI</a> is one of the best principles to follow to ensure a simple and lean code-base by focusing on what&#39;s essential to delivering value.</p><h3 id="avoid-blanket-rules" tabindex="-1">Avoid blanket rules <a class="header-anchor" href="#avoid-blanket-rules" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>We recommend avoiding &quot;blanket rules&quot; which we consider one of the primary causes of unnecessary complexity in Software, where it&#39;s often liberally and thoughtlessly applied, infecting a code-base without justification. Every time you impose an artificial limitation, you&#39;re creating friction and inertia to develop within its bounds in order to satisfy it, which is why any rule you enforce should be thoughtfully and carefully applied and limited to places where it adds value.</p><h3 id="be-wary-of-invalid-rules-and-patterns" tabindex="-1">Be wary of invalid Rules and Patterns <a class="header-anchor" href="#be-wary-of-invalid-rules-and-patterns" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Even Software Design Patterns are in many cases <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">programming language deficiencies</a>, where what&#39;s a useful in one language is unnecessary and more elegantly solved in more expressive and powerful languages. Likewise with &quot;rules&quot;, what&#39;s a cautionary guideline in one domain may not be applicable in others. Therefore what&#39;s more important than &quot;the rule&quot; itself, is the value it actually provides and what concrete side-effect it&#39;s trying to prevent. Once we understand its true value, we can optimize to derive maximum value from it and together with YAGNI, know when to selectively apply it.</p><h2 id="the-simple-poco-life" tabindex="-1">The Simple POCO Life <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-simple-poco-life" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>ServiceStack achieves a lot of its simplicity and reuse by being able to reuse the same POCOs indiscriminately anywhere to interface and freely communicate between its different libraries and components. This enables maximum value and reuse of your Models and reduces the friction in mapping between different domains which typically require having purpose-specific types, each with its own unique configuration limiting its applicability and potential re-use.</p><h3 id="heavy-orm-models-are-poor-dtos" tabindex="-1">Heavy ORM models are poor DTOs <a class="header-anchor" href="#heavy-orm-models-are-poor-dtos" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Not reusing data models as DTOs applies to Heavy ORM&#39;s which encourage Data Models with cyclical dependencies and proxied objects with tight coupling and embedded logic that can trigger unintended N+1 data access, making these models poor candidates for use as DTOs and why you should always copy them into purpose-specific DTOs that your Services can return so they&#39;re serializable without issue.</p><h3 id="clean-pocos" tabindex="-1">Clean POCOs <a class="header-anchor" href="#clean-pocos" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>The complex Data Models stored in <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.OrmLite" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OrmLite</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Redis" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redis</a> doesn&#39;t suffer from any of these issues which are able to use clean, disconnected POCOs. They&#39;re loosely-coupled, where only the &quot;Shape&quot; of the POCO is significant, i.e. moving projects and changing namespaces won&#39;t impact serialization, how it&#39;s stored in RDBMS tables, Redis data structures, Caching providers, etc. You&#39;re also not coupled to specific types, you can use a different type to insert data in OrmLite than what you use to read from it, nor does it need to be the &quot;exact Shape&quot;, as OrmLite can populate a DTO with only a subset of the fields available in the underlying table. There&#39;s also no distinction between Table, View or Stored procedure, OrmLite will happily map any result-set into any matching fields on the specified POCO, ignoring others.</p><p>Effectively this means POCOs in ServiceStack are extremely resilient and interoperable, so you can happily re-use the same DTOs in OrmLite and vice-versa without issue. If the DTO and Data models only deviate slightly, you can <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/14859968/85785" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hide them from being serialized</a> or stored in OrmLite with the attributes below:</p><div class="language-csharp"><pre><code><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token class-name">Poco</span>

At that point (YAGNI) you can take a copy of the DTO and add it to your Services Implementation so they can grow separately, unimpeded by their different concerns. You can then effortlessly convert between them using<br><a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack/wiki/Auto-mapping" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ServiceStack&#39;s built-in Auto Mapping</a>, e.g:</p><div class="language-csharp"><pre><code><span class="token class-name"><span class="token keyword">var</span></span> dto <span class="token operator">=</span> dbPoco<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token generic-method"><span class="token function">ConvertTo</span><span class="token generic class-name"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>Poco<span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

But when you are re-using Data Models as DTOs they should still be maintained in the <strong>ServiceModel</strong> project (aka DTO .dll) which should contain <strong>all the types</strong> that your Service returns. DTOs should be logic and dependency-free so the only dependency the ServiceModel project references is the impl-free <code>ServiceStack.Interfaces.dll</code> which as it&#39;s a .NET v4.5 and .NET Standard 2.0 .dll, can be freely referenced from all <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/HelloMobile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Mobile and Desktop platforms</a>.</p><p>You want to ensure all types your Services return are in the DTO .dll since this, along with the base url of where your Services are hosted is <strong>all that&#39;s required</strong> for your Service Consumers to know in order to consume your Services.

They package its capabilities and makes them available remotely to your consumers with never any more complexity than the cost of a Service call.

It separates what your Service provides from the complexity in how it realizes it. It defines the API for your Service and tells Service Consumers the minimum info they need to know to discover what functionality your Services provide and how to consume them (maintaining a similar role to Header files in C/C++ source code). Well-defined Service contracts decoupled from implementation, enforces interoperability ensuring that your Services don&#39;t mandate specific client implementations, ensuring they can be consumed by any HTTP Client on any platform.
