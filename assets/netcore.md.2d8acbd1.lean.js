The existing Windows hosting and <a href="http://VS.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS.NET</a> restraints have been freed, now anyone can develop using .NET&#39;s productive expertly-designed and statically-typed mainstream C#/F# languages in their preferred editor and host it on the most popular server Operating Systems, in either an all-Linux, all-Windows or mixed ecosystem. Not only does this flexibility increase the value of existing .NET investments but it also makes .NET appeal to the wider and highly productive developer ecosystem who&#39;ve previously disregarded .NET as an option.</p><p>.NET Core offers significant performance and stability improvements over Mono that&#39;s derived from a shared cross-platform code-base and supported by a well-resourced, active and responsive team. If you&#39;re currently running <strong>ServiceStack on Mono</strong>, we strongly recommend <strong>upgrading to .NET Core</strong> to take advantage of its superior performance, stability and its top-to-bottom supported Technology Stack.</p><p>and with that let&#39;s jump into seeing some ServiceStack Live Demos running on .NET Core in Linux...</p><h3 id="servicestack-net-core-apps-running-in-docker" tabindex="-1">ServiceStack .NET Core Apps running in Docker <a class="header-anchor" href="#servicestack-net-core-apps-running-in-docker" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Hosting .NET Core Apps immediately exposes us to the benefits of .NET Core. We&#39;ve ported the Live Demos using the most productive IDE and tooling combination we&#39;ve found for us - which is still <a href="http://VS.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS.NET</a> with ReSharper. But for deployments and hosting we now have an array of options at our disposal, including joining the thriving state-of-the-art ecosystem around building Linux Docker images and deploying them to the cloud.</p><p>For .NET Core Live Demos we&#39;ve settled on the popular power combo of:</p><ul><li>Using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travis-ci.org</a> (free for OSS projects) for running CI scripts to rebuild Docker App Images on every check-in</li><li>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS EC2 Container Service</a> for managing Docker images and instance deployments</li><li>Using <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nginx-proxy</a> setting up an nginx reverse proxy and automatically bind virtual hosts to Docker Instances</li></ul><p>You can checkout our <a href="/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs.html">Deploy .NET Core with Docker to AWS ECS Guide</a> for the details on how we&#39;ve deployed the .NET Core Live Demos, but ultimately packaging .NET Core Apps inside Docker images enables a higher-level of abstraction letting you define your entire App Server Instance with a repeatable recipe that lets you treat and deploy instances like opaque self-contained units.</p><p>With our <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/LiveDemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET 4.5 Windows Live Demos</a> we&#39;re effectively mutating a static Windows Server VM that required pre-configuring with IIS Virtual Hosts. Any infrastructure Servers each Live Demo needs, are set up out-of-band and to minimize the System administration burden, all Demos share the same Redis server instance.</p><h4 id="repeatable-isolated-no-touch-automated-deployments" tabindex="-1">Repeatable, Isolated, no-touch automated Deployments <a class="header-anchor" href="#repeatable-isolated-no-touch-automated-deployments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>But for our .NET Core Docker deployments we have proper isolation and repeatable no-touch deployments where any infrastructure services each App needs are declared in configuration and deployed in a separate Docker container along side each App to an ECS cluster - decoupling your deployments from static EC2 instances. This lets you treat your server infrastructure and deployment automation story like code, where it&#39;s checked-in with your Repo and run with your CI who packages it in a Docker Container, publishes it as an opaque Image and deploys it to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS EC2 Container Service</a>.</p><h4 id="linux-cost-savings" tabindex="-1">Linux Cost Savings <a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-cost-savings" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>In addition to the thriving ecosystem and superior automation, another benefit of hosting .NET Core Apps on Linux is the considerable cost savings of hosting on a Linux infrastructure. Docker instances enable isolation with considerably more efficiency than VM&#39;s allowing you to pack them with greater density. For .NET Core Live Demos the single T2 medium instance (<strong>$25 /month</strong>) is hosting 15 Docker Images whilst running at <strong>~50% Memory Utilization</strong> and <strong>&lt;1% CPU Utilization</strong> in its current idle state.</p><h3 id="exceptional-code-reuse" tabindex="-1">Exceptional Code reuse <a class="header-anchor" href="#exceptional-code-reuse" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Thanks to ServiceStack&#39;s high-level host agnostic API and our approach to decouple from concrete HTTP abstractions behind lightweight <code>IRequest</code> interfaces, ServiceStack projects enjoy near perfect code reuse, which allows the same ServiceStack Services to be able to run on <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a>, HttpListener SelfHosts, SOAP Endpoints, multiple MQ Hosts and .NET Core Apps.
