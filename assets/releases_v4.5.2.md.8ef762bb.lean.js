We&#39;re especially pleased with ServiceStack&#39;s near entire feature-set and level of integration we&#39;ve been able to bring to .NET Core, all maintained within a single code-base offering high source-code compatibility to maximize existing knowledge and code-reuse and reducing portability efforts, all without breaking changes to existing .NET 4.5 Customers - realizing our primary goal.</p><h3 id="net-core-the-future-of-net-on-linux" tabindex="-1">.NET Core - the future of .NET on Linux <a class="header-anchor" href="#net-core-the-future-of-net-on-linux" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Whilst the development and tooling experience is still in a transitionary period we believe .NET Core puts .NET Web and Server App development on the cusp of an exciting future - the kind .NET hasn&#39;t seen before. The existing Windows hosting and <a href="http://VS.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS.NET</a> restraints have been freed, now anyone can develop using .NET&#39;s productive expertly-designed and statically-typed mainstream C#/F# languages in their preferred editor and host it on the most popular server Operating Systems, in either an all-Linux, all-Windows or mixed ecosystem. Not only does this flexibility increase the value of existing .NET investments but it also makes .NET appeal to the wider and highly productive developer ecosystem who&#39;ve previously disregarded .NET as an option.</p><p>As one of the first high-level .NET Web Frameworks to run cross-platform on Windows, OSX and Linux, the allure of developing cross-platform .NET Web Apps on OSX/Windows and hosting on Linux was something we&#39;ve dedicated a lot of effort in supporting, but ultimately never came to pass. The inherent performance and instability issues with Mono&#39;s HTTP Stack under heavy loads and few resources dedicated to supporting <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> on Mono meant we couldn&#39;t recommend it for production workloads - resulting in a weak developer ecosystem with relatively few installations running <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> Mono in production.</p><p>This changes with .NET Core which offers significant performance and stability improvements over Mono that&#39;s derived from a shared cross-platform code-base and supported by a well-resourced, active and responsive team. If you&#39;re currently running <strong>ServiceStack on Mono</strong>, we strongly recommend <strong>upgrading to .NET Core</strong> to take advantage of its superior performance, stability and its top-to-bottom supported Technology Stack.</p><p>and with that let&#39;s jump into seeing some ServiceStack Live Demos running on .NET Core in Linux...</p><h3 id="servicestack-net-core-apps-running-in-docker" tabindex="-1">ServiceStack .NET Core Apps running in Docker! <a class="header-anchor" href="#servicestack-net-core-apps-running-in-docker" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Hosting .NET Core Apps immediately exposes us to the benefits of .NET Core. We&#39;ve ported the Live Demos using the most productive IDE and tooling combination we&#39;ve found for us - which is still <a href="http://VS.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VS.NET</a> with ReSharper. But for deployments and hosting we now have an array of options at our disposal, including joining the thriving state-of-the-art ecosystem around building Linux Docker images and deploying them to the cloud.</p><p>For .NET Core Live Demos we&#39;ve settled on the popular power combo of:</p><ul><li>Using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travis-ci.org</a> (free for OSS projects) for running CI scripts to rebuild Docker App Images on every check-in</li><li>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS EC2 Container Service</a> for managing Docker images and instance deployments</li><li>Using <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nginx-proxy</a> setting up an nginx reverse proxy and automatically bind virtual hosts to Docker Instances</li></ul><p>We&#39;ve published a <a href="/deploy-netcore-docker-aws-ecs.html">step-by-step guide around our AWS ECS deployment story</a> where ultimately packaging .NET Core Apps inside Docker images enables a higher-level of abstraction letting you define your entire App Server Instance with a repeatable recipe that lets you treat and deploy instances like opaque self-contained units.</p><p>With our .NET 4.5 Windows Live Demos we&#39;re effectively mutating a static Windows Server VM that required pre-configuring with IIS Virtual Hosts. Any infrastructure Servers each Live Demo needs, are set up out-of-band and to minimize the System administration burden, all Demos share the same Redis server instance.</p><h4 id="repeatable-isolated-no-touch-automated-deployments" tabindex="-1">Repeatable, Isolated, no-touch automated Deployments <a class="header-anchor" href="#repeatable-isolated-no-touch-automated-deployments" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>But for our .NET Core Docker deployments we have proper isolation and repeatable no-touch deployments where any infrastructure services each App needs are declared in configuration and deployed in a separate Docker container along side each App to an ECS cluster - decoupling your deployments from static EC2 instances. This lets you treat your server infrastructure and deployment automation story like code, where it&#39;s checked-in with your Repo and run with your CI who packages it in a Docker Container, publishes it as an opaque Image and deploys it to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS EC2 Container Service</a>.</p><h4 id="linux-cost-savings" tabindex="-1">Linux Cost Savings <a class="header-anchor" href="#linux-cost-savings" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>In addition to the thriving ecosystem and superior automation, another benefit of hosting .NET Core Apps on Linux is the considerable cost savings of hosting on a Linux infrastructure. Docker instances enable isolation with considerably more efficiency than VM&#39;s allowing you to pack them with greater density. For .NET Core Live Demos the single T2 medium instance (<strong>$25 /month</strong>) is hosting 15 Docker Images whilst running at <strong>~50% Memory Utilization</strong> and <strong>&lt;1% CPU Utilization</strong> in its current idle state.</p><h2 id="net-core-live-demos" tabindex="-1">.NET Core Live Demos! <a class="header-anchor" href="#net-core-live-demos"

The benefits of an API-first approach is that you&#39;ll naturally get a well-defined servicified interface which can be consumed by all consumers including Web, Native Mobile and Desktop Apps whilst also enabling simplified B2B Integrations, Automation, Integration testing, etc.</p><h4 id="no-ceremony-dynamic-pages-without-controllers" tabindex="-1"><a href="http://razor.netcore.io/#no-ceremony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No Ceremony Dynamic Pages without Controllers</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#no-ceremony-dynamic-pages-without-controllers" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4><p>In a lot of cases where you&#39;re not developing Web Forms accepting User Input (e.g. generating a dynamic page using simple page-specific db queries) you won&#39;t need a Controller or Service at all. For this scenario we developed <a href="http://razor.netcore.io/#smart-views" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Controller-less Razor Pages</a>, where if you specify a Typed <code>@model</code>, ServiceStack automatically populates it from the HTTP Request Params and when no <code>@model</code> exists ServiceStack instead populates the Request params in a <code>ViewDataDictionary</code> - in both cases letting you access any Request Params using <strong>@Model.Name</strong> notation.</p><p>Razor Pages also lets you layout your Razor Views in whatever structure you want under <code>/wwwroot</code> which it will let you call using <a href="http://razor.netcore.io/#no-ceremony" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pretty URLs by default</a> so you&#39;re not led into following the MVC-specific <code>{Controller}/{Action}</code> pattern or made to define Custom Routes.</p><p>.NET Core Razor Pages implementation also lets you structure your Razor Pages under <code>/Views/Pages</code> as an alternative to maintaining them under <code>/wwwroot</code>.</p><h3 id="mvc-razor-pages" tabindex="-1">MVC Razor Pages <a class="header-anchor" href="#mvc-razor-pages" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Unfortunately in .NET Core we weren&#39;t able to reuse any of our existing <strong>ServiceStack.Razor</strong> implementation, but as we found the development model and end-user experience of Razor without MVC Controllers and Actions much more productive we investigated how it could best be implemented in .NET Core. Unfortunately .NET Core&#39;s Razor support is tightly coupled to MVC&#39;s implementation, but fortunately for us MVC also provided the necessary APIs where we could re-implement ServiceStack.Razor&#39;s user-facing features using just MVC Razor Views.</p><p>In many ways this turned out to be a blessing in disguise as by using MVC&#39;s implementation we also get access to new MVC .NET Core features and its surrounding ecosystem like Tag Helpers. MVC also takes care of live-reloading Razor Views behind-the-scenes so we&#39;re also able to get the same iterative development experience we&#39;re used to. By using MVC Views we also naturally get good tooling support which <a href="https://docs.servicestack.net/razor-notes.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be a dark art in .NET 4.5</a> which was tightly coupled to <strong>Web.config</strong> configuration and therefore poorly supported in Self-Hosting Console Apps.</p><blockquote><p>Currently ReSharper&#39;s tooling has issues with Razor Views inheriting Custom base classes - which can be resolved by installing the latest EAP or disabling its <strong><a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> Razor</strong> support.</p></blockquote><p>Overall we&#39;re ecstatic with the end-result, we retain our Controller-free development model whilst Razor under .NET Core executes noticeably quicker than <a href="http://ASP.NET" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASP.NET</a> and significantly faster on Linux vs using Mono.</p><h3 id="razorformat-usage" tabindex="-1">RazorFormat Usage <a class="header-anchor" href="#razorformat-usage" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>You can find .NET Core Razor features documented in <a href="http://razor.netcore.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">razor.netcore.io</a> which is maintained in our MVC NuGet package that can be installed with:</p><pre><code>PM&gt; Install-Package ServiceStack.Mvc.Core
