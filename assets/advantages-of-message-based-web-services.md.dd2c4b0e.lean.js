An example of this was having developed over 100+ Web Services for the <a href="http://redisadminui.servicestack.net/redis/metadata" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redis WebServices</a> project in just 1 weekend. Others that have tried ServiceStack also agree its ease-of-development and <strong>&quot;pit of success&quot;</strong> design it promotes ultimately yields a productivity win - this positive sentiment is captured in <a href="https://twitter.com/ServiceStack/likes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ServiceStack&#39;s favourites</a> and throughout the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/servicestack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mailing group</a>.</p><h3 id="the-anatomy-of-a-servicestack-service" tabindex="-1">The anatomy of a ServiceStack service <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-anatomy-of-a-servicestack-service" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>For normal services, ServiceStack is an invisible library i.e. it lets you implement your service in pure, untainted C# accepting any user-defined Request and lets you return any Response DTO without any regard to endpoints and formats. Any dependencies your services need can be declared as public properties and are automatically auto-wired on each request. A complete example of this is the self-contained <a href="https://github.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStack.Examples/blob/master/src/Backbone.Todos/Global.asax.cs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Backbone TODO backend persisted using Redis</a>.</p><h3 id="in-contrast-with-soap" tabindex="-1"><a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/interview-servicestack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In contrast with SOAP</a> <a class="header-anchor" href="#in-contrast-with-soap" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>By contrast we&#39;ve witnessed .NET devs struggling to implement much fewer SOAP web services within the same timeframe, especially when they&#39;re fighting un-expected and unknown WCF interoperability issues. Not only is SOAP more verbose and slower, its less tolerant and version-able, it was never a good choice for the open web and is now effectively deprecated.</p><h2 id="the-many-webservice-frameworks-of-microsoft" tabindex="-1">The many webservice frameworks of Microsoft <a class="header-anchor" href="#the-many-webservice-frameworks-of-microsoft" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>Unfortunately despite Microsoft having hosted Martin Fowler&#39;s respected <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff649585.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Data Transfer Object</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff650101.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Service Gateway</a> patterns on MSDN for years - none of their web frameworks have encouraged their use. Instead in .NET we&#39;ve been forced to code against the multiple generation of replacement web service frameworks they&#39;ve churned out over the years like .asmx, CSF, WCF, WCF/REST, WSE, WCF DataServices, RIA, MVC (escaping earlier cruft) and now WebApi. Each of these frameworks share the same mistake of mapping to C# methods, which we believe is a terrible idea for network services since it promotes chatty and brittle remote interfaces, that fail to facilitate the easy creation of SOA-like Apis.</p><p>Throughout all these generations of frameworks ServiceStack&#39;s underlying core message-based design has remained a constant powerful primitive that drives much of its simplicity. At a minimum ServiceStack Services just need to implement the empty marker interface:</p><div class="language-csharp"><pre><code><span class="token keyword">public</span> <span class="token keyword">interface</span> <span class="token class-name">IService</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span>

This encourages fewer, more re-usable services that are better positioned for extensibility - this is a key benefit, since well-defined (i.e. non RPC/client-specific) back-end services tend to out live the UIs and clients that consume them.</p><p>This is illustrated in this example between the <a href="https://gist.github.com/1386381" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different style of services that WCF and ServiceStack encourages</a>. Another example showcasing the differences is in many of jQuery&#39;s APIs that take in an array of key/value pairs, like <a href="http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.ajax/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$.ajax()</a>. Imagine if every configuration permutation was a different or overloaded method? This gets unwieldy, very quickly.

When you evolve and refactor a C# method you have the opportunity to refactor all the call sites to meet the new method signature - whereas in a disconnected (and already deployed) client/server solution you don&#39;t, you need to support both old and new clients requests and the only way to do this cleanly whilst still maintaining the same code-path is to pass messages between them.</p><p>But the main disadvantage of method signature service APIs is that they mandate the use of code-gen in order to provide a typed client API. Using messages allows you to re-use generic service clients for all your service communications. This is how, even up to this day ServiceStack remains the only .NET framework to maintain a terse, (both sync and async), typed, end-to-end client libraries without any code-gen, e.g:</p><div class="language-cs"><pre><code><span class="token class-name">Todo</span> createdTodo <span class="token operator">=</span> client<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">Post</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token keyword">new</span> <span class="token constructor-invocation class-name">Todo</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> Content <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">&quot;New Todo&quot;</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> Order <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span>

You can guarantee that your dataflow is more or less going to work, and focus on the functional aspects. Whereas for something like building a web page you don&#39;t want to recompile all the time, you don&#39;t really want to worry about whether in some edge condition you are going to get a type you didn&#39;t expect.

This is a popular choice for many companies today, some good examples include <a href="http://api.stackoverflow.com/1.0/usage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a> and <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.

This is generally the approach of companies who really, really want to help you use their services - they tend to call their clients <strong>SDK&#39;s</strong> which abstract away the underlying connection transport behind optimal native language bindings. This is especially evident from companies whose business relies on the popular use of their APIs, like <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/sdkfornet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/sdks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://github.com/WindowsAzure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Windows Azure</a>. This is an especially good idea if you want to support static languages (i.e. C# and Java) where having typed client libraries saves end-users from reverse engineering the types and API calls. It also saves them having to look up documentation since a lot of it can be inferred from the type info. ServiceStack&#39;s and Amazons convention of having <code>ServiceName</code> and <code>ServiceNameResponse</code> for each service also saves users from continually checking documentation to work out what the response of each service will be.</p><h3 id="packaging-client-libraries" tabindex="-1">Packaging client libraries <a class="header-anchor" href="#packaging-client-libraries" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>In terms of packaging your client libraries, sticking a link to a zip file on your Websites APIs documentation page would be the easiest approach. It would be better if the zip file was a link to a master archive of a Github repository as you&#39;ll be able to accept bug fixes and usability tips from the community. Finally we believe the best way to make your client libraries available would be to host them in the target languages native package manager - letting end-users issue 1-command to automatically add it to their project, and another to easily update it when your service has changed.</p><h3 id="nuget-is-the-new-add-service-reference" tabindex="-1">NuGet is the new Add Service Reference <a class="header-anchor" href="#nuget-is-the-new-add-service-reference" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>For .NET this means adding it to NuGet.
