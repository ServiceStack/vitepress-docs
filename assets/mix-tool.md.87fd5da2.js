Mix using numbered list index instead:

Delete previously mixed gists:
   x mix -delete &lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt; ...

Use custom project name instead of current folder name (replaces MyApp):

Replace additional tokens before mixing:
   x mix -replace term=with &lt;name&gt; &lt;name&gt; ...

Multi replace with escaped string example:

For example you can enable Authentication, register an RDBMS Auth Repository using SQL Server with:</p><div class="language-bash"><pre><code>$ x mix auth auth-db sqlserver
</code></pre></div><p>Which will apply the <a href="https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/1ec54e10d44f87e0f20daaf7e2248fea" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configure.Auth.cs</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/16fddde0763b3eee516d670ab9fab194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configure.AuthRepository.cs</a> and <a href="https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/7075e53e1fe69d3da12996677b5f3a5a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Configure.Db.cs</a> gists.</p><p>If you later wanted to switch to PostgreSQL, you can <code>mix</code> it in with:</p><div class="language-bash"><pre><code>$ x mix postgres

</code></pre></div><p>Where it will override the existing <code>Configure.AuthRepository.cs</code> added by <strong>auth-db</strong>.</p><h3 id="undo-mix" tabindex="-1">Undo mix <a class="header-anchor" href="#undo-mix" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>In addition to being easy to add, <code>mix</code> makes it easy to undo where you can specify the <code>-delete</code> flag to remove all the Gist files added by all features, e.g:</p><div class="language-bash"><pre><code>$ x mix -delete auth auth-db sqlserver

E.g. The Auth Repositories include an example of maintaining a custom <code>UserAuth</code> model, registering the <a href="/sessions.html#session-events">Auth Event</a> to populate their additional fields on Authentication and sample code necessary for ensuring a specific Admin User is created on <code>Startup</code>:</p><div class="language-csharp"><pre><code><span class="token keyword">namespace</span> <span class="token namespace">MyApp</span>
