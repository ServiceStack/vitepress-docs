Whilst there have been a number of deployment strategies that have been adopted over the years, the current state-of-the-art is the standardization around the <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker container format</a> which hits the sweet spot of providing isolation within a minimal footprint over encapsulating your App and its dependencies which is contrast to including an entire Operating System when using VM&#39;s. In addition to being lightweight and efficient to run, Docker also enables fast, reproducible builds where your entire App&#39;s Image can be rebuilt by your CI Server on each check-in - bringing the same benefits of version control and continuous integration on your code to your Server infrastructure - which can now be easily be versioned, replicated, scaled and automated.</p><p>Once built, your Docker App is treated like an opaque Image where the fact it&#39;s running .NET Core instead of a pure LAMP stack becomes a transparent implementation detail that doesn&#39;t impact the utility of your App, who are both able to equally benefit from Docker&#39;s rich ecosystem. E.g. your Docker App can be uploaded to any public Docker repository where it can be easily shared and run on any <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">supported Linux Distrobution</a>. In addition to being able to run any published Docker image on any Docker-enabled OS, you&#39;re also able to use it as a the source image for your own custom Docker Image, a feature that you&#39;ll take advantage of when building your own .NET Core Docker App which is based on Microsoft&#39;s <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">microsoft/dotnet</a> Docker Image that&#39;s published on <a href="https://hub.docker.com/explore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker&#39;s public repository</a>.</p><h2 id="native-docker-integration-in-the-cloud" tabindex="-1">Native Docker Integration in the Cloud <a class="header-anchor" href="#native-docker-integration-in-the-cloud" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>As the premier Container format for packaging Server Apps, all major cloud providers include native support for Docker that goes beyond the basic hosting of Docker Images to also include repository management, monitoring, inspection and orchestration which lets you easily (or automatically) scale your Docker App on a managed cluster of VMs. You can learn more about the Docker integration offerings of the major Cloud providers in the links below:</p><ul><li><strong>AWS</strong> - <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon EC2 Container Service</a></li><li><strong>Azure</strong> - <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Container Service</a></li><li><strong>Google Cloud</strong> - <a href="https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Container Engine</a></li></ul><p>Whilst other popular Cloud providers like <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Ocean</a> make it trivial to <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/one-click-apps/docker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">setup a Docker Server in seconds</a>.</p><h2 id="aws-ec2-container-service" tabindex="-1">AWS EC2 Container Service <a class="header-anchor" href="#aws-ec2-container-service" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>For this guide we&#39;ll walk through how we&#39;ve deployed our <a href="https://github.com/NetCoreApps/LiveDemos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">.NET Core Live Demos</a> using the popular power combo of:</p><ul><li>Using <a href="https://travis-ci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">travis-ci.org</a> (free for OSS projects) for running CI scripts to rebuild Docker App Images on every check-in</li><li>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS EC2 Container Service</a> for managing Docker images and instance deployments</li><li>Using <a href="https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nginx-proxy</a> setting up an nginx reverse proxy and automatically bind virtual hosts to Docker Instances</li></ul><p>We&#39;ll also look at covering <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Azure Container Service</a> in future as it&#39;s another popular option for deploying and hosting .NET Core Docker Apps.</p><h2 id="deploying-to-aws-container-service-overview" tabindex="-1">Deploying to AWS Container Service Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#deploying-to-aws-container-service-overview" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2><p>In this guide we&#39;ll go through setting up your AWS Account to enable Docker deployments using AWS EC2 Container Service and have them deploy to a single EC2 Instance for optimal value and minimal cost.

With the warning message AWS is encouraging you to limit your SSH access to a limited IP Range which if you have a <strong>static IP</strong> from your ISP is a good idea to lock down the <strong>Source</strong> to <code>My IP</code>, otherwise leaving it open to any IP is ok as we&#39;ll be using a Private Key to login to our Instance.</p><p><img src="https://docs.servicestack.net/images/aws/ecs/launch-05.png" alt=""></p><p>On the next page you want to either create a new Public/Private Key Pair or use an existing one.
