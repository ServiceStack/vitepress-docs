However, when just getting started on a project, setting up Application Load Balancers, CloudFront CDN, AutoScaling Groups etc can be a high entry point from a monthly cost and complexity standpoint. It also provides an alternative to &#39;serverless&#39; solutions that avoid issues like cold starts as well as polluting any of your code with cloud provider specific implementation.</p><p>We&#39;ve created a new <code>x mix release-ecr-aws</code> template to try and help solo developers and small teams that think they might use a more mature AWS ECS setup in the future, but don&#39;t have the budget or just want a cheap host for a prototype/demo. Once your product grows, integrating all the other AWS infrastructure is a smaller and clearer path than trying to do it from the very beginning, not knowing if you&#39;ll ever need it.</p><p>We&#39;re also going to leverage the powerful GitHub Actions platform so that the distance between your CI environment and code is as small as possible. The <code>x mix release-ecr-aws</code> template provides a starting point for your ServiceStack application to have a CI setup and deploy to a <strong>single</strong> server in ECS to keep costs down. This is good for prototyping an idea or any low request rate applications where you think you&#39;ll move into a more standard ECS infrastructure pattern as your application usage increases.</p><h3 id="hosting-setup" tabindex="-1">Hosting setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#hosting-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Since we are trying to keep costs at a minimal, just like our Digital Ocean hosting, we are using just 1 EC2 instance to (potentially) host multiple low traffic applications with minimal infrastructure. In this pattern we are using</p><ul><li>Route53 (DNS)</li><li>1 EC2 instance</li><li>ECS (to manage our deployments)</li><li>ECR (to stored our docker images)</li></ul><p>The lion share of the costs will come from the single EC2 instance which you can match for size depending on how many applications you want to host on the 1 instance, a t3.micro is ~$8/month. ECR (docker repository) does cost money for storage at ~$0.10 per GB/month. $0.50 a month for a Route53 hosted zone. So while this is not quite as cheap as Digital Ocean setup we&#39;ve shown, it is a stepping stone into using AWS ECS for a much larger horizontally scaling hosting setup without much change.</p><p>Keeping parts to our setup to a minimum, Route 53 points each subomain to the IP address of our EC2 instance, nginx-proxy routes traffic to each application running in docker.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/cloudcraft-host-digram-release-ecr-aws.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="deployment-setup" tabindex="-1">Deployment setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#deployment-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>In the <code>release-ecr-aws</code> template we are using <code>ecr</code> for the storage of our Docker images and ECS for the deployment. Everything runes on GitHub Actions as provided by the template and your specific details are provided by GitHub Secrets (stored at the repository or organization level).</p><p>The GitHub Actions require an ECS cluster to be created with a single EC2 instance as member of that cluster.

For this tutorial, we&#39;ll start with a new ServiceStack application using <code>x new</code> and incorporate the GitHub Action templates to get our CI environment started.</p><p>First, create your new git repository on GitHub.</p><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/github-create-new-repo.png" alt=""></p><p>Once created, follow the GitHub wizard and clone it to your local machine.</p><p>Then you can use the following commands to get your new ServiceStack application setup in GitHub with GitHub Actions.</p><blockquote><p>Choose the appropriate web template from <code>x new</code> for your needs as most templates are compatible GitHub Actions <code>x mix</code> templates. <code>x new web</code> will create a project in an existing directory, <code>x new web WebApp</code> will create the project in a new <code>WebApp</code> folder.</p></blockquote><div class="language-"><pre><code>git clone &lt;Git URL&gt;

These types of setups can be unnecessarily costly and complex and if you are a solo developer or small team (for which is pattern is more suited), is likely not suitable starting point. As your application infrastructure needs evolve, so can your cloud provider environment, this template provides a starting point with AWS ECS while keeping costs to a minimum.</p><p>As previously stated above, this template needs the following in AWS:</p><ul><li>A <strong>dedicated</strong> ECS cluster (not shared)</li><li>Single EC2 server registered to that ECS cluster</li><li>IAM User Credentials with <code>AmazonEC2ContainerRegistryFullAccess</code> and <code>AmazonECS_FullAccess</code> for use (exclusively) by GitHub Actions.</li><li>Route53 (or other DNS manager) with an A record pointing to the EC2 instance public IP</li></ul><h3 id="ecs-cluster" tabindex="-1">ECS Cluster <a class="header-anchor" href="#ecs-cluster" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>An empty ECS Cluster is needed as the GitHub Action process won&#39;t create this for you. You can choose to use the ECS Cluster wizard to create you an Auto-scaling Group, security groups, etc but the idea to start with is to just start with an empty ECS Cluster that an EC2 instance will join when we create it. This pattern doesn&#39;t scale horizontally with additional EC2 instances, but since it does use ECS, changing to use a load balancer and target groups can be introduced once they are needed.</p><blockquote><p>If you know you need horizontal scaling, it would be suggested to jump straight to using Application Load Balancer with Target Groups to manage your cluster services routing with the additional costs that come with that. The base cost of an ALB is ~$20/month, costs also scales up with requests. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">See pricing details</a>, the use of &quot;LCU&quot;s makes it highly dependent on your use case.</p></blockquote><p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/create-cluster-ecs-1.png" alt=""> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/create-cluster-ecs-2.png" alt=""></p><h3 id="ec2-instance-setup" tabindex="-1">EC2 Instance Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#ec2-instance-setup" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Now we can create the EC2 instance, the goal being is that our EC2 instance will join our cluster and run docker + ECS agent to work with this setup.</p><h3 id="choose-ami" tabindex="-1">Choose AMI <a class="header-anchor" href="#choose-ami" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>You need to use the AWS <code>Optimized for ECS</code> images, the easiest way to find the latest Amazon Linux 2 image for this is to go to the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs-optimized_AMI.html#ecs-optimized-ami-linux" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS documentation for ECS-optimized AMIs and look up your region here</a>.</p><p>Using the AMI ID (starts with <code>ami-</code>) at the bottom, search in the &#39;Community AMIs&#39; tab on the first step of the <code>Launch EC2 Instance</code> wizard.</p><h3 id="choose-instance-type" tabindex="-1">Choose Instance Type <a class="header-anchor" href="#choose-instance-type" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>A t3.micro or larger will work fine, this pattern can be used to host multiple applications on the 1 server so if the number of applications gets larger, you might need a larger instance type.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>this pattern is suitable for testing prototypes or low traffic applications as it is cost effective and makes it easy to bundle multiple apps onto 1 EC2 instance.</p></div><h3 id="configure-instance" tabindex="-1">Configure Instance <a class="header-anchor" href="#configure-instance" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3><p>Under <code>IAM role</code>, use the <code>ecsInstanceRole</code>, if this is not available, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/instance_IAM_role.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AWS documentation for the process of checking if it exists and creating it if needed</a>.</p><p>If you are <em>not</em> using your own generated Elastic IP, select <code>Enabled</code> for <code>Auto-assign Public IP</code>.</p><p>You will also want to add the following Userdata script (in the <code>Configure</code> step of the launch wizard) with your own <code>ECS_CLUSTER</code> value.
