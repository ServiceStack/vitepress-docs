title: Create your first WebService
---

This is a quick walkthrough of getting your first web service up and running whilst having a look at the how some of the different components work. 

## Step 1: Install the x dotnet tool

First we want to install the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool):

    $ dotnet tool install --global x 

The [dotnet tools](/dotnet-tool) are ServiceStack's versatile companion giving you quick access to a lot of its high-level features including 
generating mobile, web & desktop DTOs with [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference) generating [gRPC Clients and proto messages](/grpc),
quickly [apply gists](/mix-tool) to your project enabled by ServiceStack's effortless [no-touch Modular features](/modular-startup), it even
includes a [lisp REPL](https://sharpscript.net/lisp/) should you need to explore your [remote .NET Core App in real-time](https://sharpscript.net/lisp/#techstacks-tcp-lisp-repl-demo). 

## Step 2: Selecting a template

Importantly, the dotnet tools lets you create [.NET Core, .NET Framework](/dotnet-new) and [ASP.NET Core on .NET Framework](/templates-corefx) projects.
Unless you're restricted to working with .NET Framework you'll want to start with a [.NET Core project template](/dotnet-new#usage), for this example
we'll start with the Empty [web](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/web) template which implicitly uses the folder name for the Project Name:

    $ x new web WebApp

## Step 3: Run your project

Press `Ctrl+F5` to run your project!

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/empty_project_run.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/ServiceStackVS/master/Images/empty_project_run.png)

#### Watched builds

An alternative to running your project in your IDE is to run a watched build using the `dotnet` tool on the command-line:

    $ dotnet watch run

Where it will automatically rebuild & restart your App when it detects any changes to your App's source files.

### How does it work?

Now that your new project is running, let's have a look at what we have. The template comes with a single web service route which comes from the request DTO (Data Transfer Object) which is located in the [Hello.cs](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/web/blob/master/MyApp.ServiceModel/Hello.cs) file:

```csharp
[Route("/hello/{Name}")]
public class Hello : IReturn<HelloResponse>
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

public class HelloResponse
{
    public string Result { get; set; }
}
```

The `Route` attribute is specifying what path `/hello/{Name}` where `{Name}` binds its value to the public string property of **Name**.

Let's access the route to see what comes back. Go to the following URL in your address bar, where <root_path> is your server address.

    http://{BaseUrl}/hello/world

You will see a snapshot of the Result in a HTML response format. To change the return format to Json, simply add `?format=json` to the end of the URL. You'll learn more about formats, endpoints (URLs, etc) when you continue reading the documentation.

If we go back to the solution and find the WebApplication1.ServiceInterface and open the `MyServices.cs` file, we can have a look at the code that is responding to the browser, giving us the `Result` back.

```csharp
public class MyServices : Service
{
    public object Any(Hello request)
    {
        return new HelloResponse { Result = $"Hello, {request.Name}!" };
    }
}
```

If we look at the code above, there are a few things to note. The name of the method `Any` means the server will run this method for any of the valid HTTP Verbs. Service methods are where you control what returns from your service.

## Step 4: Exploring the ServiceStack Solution

The Recommended structure below is built into all ServiceStackVS VS.NET Templates where creating any new ServiceStack 
project will create a solution with a minimum of 4 projects below ensuring ServiceStack solutions starts off from an optimal 
logical project layout, laying the foundation for growing into a more maintainable, cohesive and reusable code-base:

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/solution-layout.png" />

### Host Project

The Host project contains your AppHost which references and registers all your App's concrete dependencies in its IOC and is the central location where all App configuration and global behavior is maintained. It also references all Web Assets like Razor Views, JS, CSS, Images, Fonts, etc. that's needed to be deployed with the App. The AppHost is the top-level project which references all dependencies used by your App whose role is akin to an orchestrator and conduit where it decides what functionality is made available and which concrete implementations are used. By design it references all other (non-test) projects whilst nothing references it and as a goal should be kept free of any App or Business logic.

### ServiceInterface Project

The ServiceInterface project is the implementation project where all Business Logic and Services live which typically references every other project except the Host projects. Small and Medium projects can maintain all their implementation here where logic can be grouped under feature folders. Large solutions can split this project into more manageable cohesive and modular projects which we also recommend encapsulates any dependencies they might use.

### ServiceModel Project

The ServiceModel Project contains all your Application's DTOs which is what defines your Services contract, keeping them isolated from any Server implementation is how your Service is able to encapsulate its capabilities and make them available behind a remote facade. There should be only one ServiceModel project per solution which contains all your DTOs and should be implementation, dependency and logic-free which should only reference the impl/dep-free **ServiceStack.Interfaces.dll** contract assembly to ensure Service contracts are decoupled from its implementation, enforces interoperability ensuring that your Services don't mandate specific client implementations and will ensure this is the only project clients need to be able to call any of your Services by either referencing the **ServiceModel.dll** directly or downloading the DTOs from a remote ServiceStack instance using [Add ServiceStack Reference](/add-servicestack-reference):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/dtos-role.png)

### Test Project

The Unit Test project contains all your Unit and Integration tests. It's also a Host project that typically references all other non-Host projects in the solution and contains a combination of concrete and mock dependencies depending on what's being tested. See the [Testing Docs](/testing) for more information on testing ServiceStack projects.

### ServiceStack Integration

### jQuery

ServiceStack's clean Web Services design makes it simple and intuitive to be able to call ServiceStack Services from any ajax client, e.g. from a [simple Bootstrap Website using jQuery](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Templates/blob/master/src/ServiceStackVS/BootstrapWebApp/BootstrapWebApp/default.cshtml):

```html
<div>
    <div>
        <input class="form-control" id="Name" type="text" placeholder="Type your name">
        <p id="result"></p>
    </div>
</div>
<script>
$('#Name').keyup(function () {
    let name = $(this).val();
    if (name) {
        $.getJSON('/hello/' + name)
            .success(function (response) {
                $('#result').html(response.Result);
            });
    } else {
        $('#result').html('');
    }
});
</script>
```

### Dependency-free JsonServiceClient & Typed DTOs in Web Pages

A **dep-free alternative** to jQuery that works in all modern browsers is to use the 
[UMD @servicestack/client](https://github.com/ServiceStack/servicestack-client) built into `ServiceStack.dll` along with the transpiled 
[TypeScript Generated DTOs](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference) to enable an optimal typed modern async API:

```html
<h2><a href="/json/metadata?op=Hello">Hello</a> API</h2>
<input type="text" id="txtName" onkeyup="callHello(this.value)">
<div id="result"></div>

<script>
  var exports = { __esModule:true }, module = { exports:exports }
  function require(name) { return exports[name] || window[name] }
</script>
<script src="/js/servicestack-client.js"></script>
<script src="/dtos.js"></script>
<script>
Object.assign(window, exports) //import

let client = new JsonServiceClient()
function callHello(val) {
client.get(new Hello({ name: val }))
  .then(function(r) {
      document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = r.result;
  })
}
</script>
```

Where you can update your App's server DTOs by transpiling them to JavaScript & moving to `/wwwroot`:

    $ npm run dtos

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/init.png)

### Rich intelli-sense support

Even pure HTML/JS Apps that don't use TypeScript or any external dependencies will still benefit from the Server 
generated `dtos.ts` and `servicestack-client.d.ts` definitions as Smart IDEs like 
[Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) can make use of them to provide a rich productive development UX
on both the built-in `/js/servicestack-client.js` library:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/init-rider-ts-client.png)

As well as your App's server generated DTOs:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/init-rider-ts-dto.png)

Including their typed partial constructors:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ServiceStack/docs/master/docs/images/mix/init-rider-ts-dto-props.png)

So even simple Apps without complex bundling solutions or external dependencies can still benefit from a rich typed authoring 
experience without any additional build time or tooling complexity.

### Using mix to quickly create empty .NET Core Apps

As this requires no external deps or prescribed JS frameworks, it's used in the [init and init-lts](/mix-tool#mix-usage) mix scripts which you can 
quickly add & run using the [x dotnet tool](/dotnet-tool):

    $ dotnet tool install --global x 

Which can be used to quickly create & run a new .NET Core App in an empty directory:

    $ mkdir ProjectName && cd ProjectName
    $ x mix init
    $ dotnet run

Which will install the [init Gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/58030e271595520d87873c5df5e4c2eb) to your local directory using the `ProjectName` 
directory name for the new Project name.

#### Empty VB.NET .NET Core App

Use `init-vb` to create a VB .NET Core App:

    $ mkdir ProjectName && cd ProjectName
    $ x mix init-vb
    $ dotnet run

Which will install the [init-vb Gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/88f2792fc4820de7dc4e68c0c5d76126).

#### Empty F# .NET Core App

Use `init-fsharp` to create a F# .NET Core App:

    $ mkdir ProjectName && cd ProjectName
    $ x mix init-fsharp
    $ dotnet run

Which will install the [init-fsharp Gist](https://gist.github.com/gistlyn/4802ba22b665e68c7257aef9f57c1934).

### TypeScript or JavaScript SPA Apps

The same [TypeScript JsonServiceClient](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference#typescript-serviceclient) is also used in more sophisticated 
JavaScript Apps like [React Native](/typescript-add-servicestack-reference#react-native-jsonserviceclient) to 
[node.js Server Apps](https://github.com/ServiceStackApps/typescript-server-events) as well as all TypeScript SPA Project Templates, 
such as this [example using React](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Templates/blob/master/src/SinglePageApps/ReactApp1/ReactApp1/src/home/Hello.tsx):

```tsx
import './hello.css';

import * as React from 'react';
import { Input } from '@servicestack/react';
import { client } from '../../shared';
import { Hello } from '../../shared/dtos';

export interface HelloApiProps {
    name: string;
}

export const HelloApi: React.FC<any> = (props:HelloApiProps) => {
    const [name, setName] = React.useState(props.name);
    const [result, setResult] = React.useState('');

    React.useEffect(() => {
        (async () => {
            setResult(!name ? '' : (await client.get(new Hello({ name }) )).result)
        })();
    }, [name]); // fires when name changes

    return (<div>
        <div className="form-group">
            <Input value={name} onChange={setName} placeholder="Your name" />
            <h3 className="result pt-2">{ result }</h3>
        </div>
    </div>);
}
```

Compare and contrast with other major SPA JavaScript Frameworks:

 - [Vue.js HelloApi.vue](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/vue-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/components/Home/HelloApi.vue)
 - [React HelloApi.tsx](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/react-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/components/Home/HelloApi.tsx)
 - [Angular HelloApi.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/angular-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/app/home/HelloApi.ts)
 - [Svelte Home.svelte](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/svelte-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/components/Home.svelte)
 - [Aurelia hello.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/aurelia-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/resources/elements/hello.ts)
 - [Angular v4 hello.ts](https://github.com/NetCoreTemplates/angular-lite-spa/blob/master/MyApp/src/modules/app/home/hello.ts)
 - [Angular.js v1.5 using $http](https://github.com/ServiceStack/Templates/blob/master/src/ServiceStackVS/AngularJSApp/AngularJSApp/js/hello/controllers.js)

### Full .NET Project Templates
